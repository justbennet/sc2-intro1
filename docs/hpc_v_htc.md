# High what?

## High performance computing

High Performance Computing most generally refers to the practice of
aggregating computing power in a way that delivers much higher performance
than one could get out of a typical desktop computer or workstation in
order to solve large problems in science, engineering, or business.

[Inside HPC](https://insidehpc.com/hpc-basic-training/what-is-hpc/)

High-performance computing (HPC) is the use of parallel processing for
running advanced application programs efficiently, reliably and quickly.
The term applies especially to systems that function above a teraflop or
10^12 floating-point operations per second.

High-performance computing (HPC) is the use of super computers and parallel
processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. HPC
technology focuses on developing parallel processing algorithms and systems
by incorporating both administration and parallel computational techniques.

## High throughput computing

High-throughput computing (HTC) is a computer science term to describe the
use of many computing resources over long periods of time to accomplish a
computational task.

As an alternative definition, the European Grid Infrastructure defines HTC
as “a computing paradigm that focuses on the efficient execution of a large
number of loosely-coupled tasks”,[2] while HPC systems tend to focus on
tightly coupled parallel jobs, and as such they must execute within a
particular site with low-latency interconnects. Conversely, HTC systems
are independent, sequential jobs that can be individually scheduled on
many different computing resources across multiple administrative
boundaries.

It is not uncommon to find problems that require weeks or months of
computation to solve. Scientists and engineers engaged in this sort of
work need a computing environment that delivers large amounts of
computational power over a long period of time. Such an environment
is called a High-Throughput Computing (HTC) environment.

[Condor manual](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/current/1_1High_Throughput_Computin.html)

In contrast to HPC, high throughput computing does not aim to optimize
a single application but several users and applications. In this way,
many applications share a computing infrastructure at the same time
&ndash; in this way the overall throughput of several applications is
supposed to be maximized.

## University of Michigan clusters

The clusters available at the University of Michigan are a kind of
hybrid system that attempts to provide both kinds of &lsquo;high&rsquo;
on the same system.
